A web page to reserve hostels.

This project will be presented as a professional aptitude test for our course.

By [Daniel Rocha](https://github.com/GODManiax), João Cerqueira and [Luís Leite](https://github.com/Ochii).

Thank you to teacher Gil Manuel de Carvalho for guiding us.

## Setting up

You must have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed in your machine in order to obtain third party dependencies, follow each app's website instructions on how to obtain each.

If your machine is running Windows, run the Powershell script ```setup.ps1```, else you should run ```setup.sh```.

To import the MySQL table ```HostelReservation.sql```, run ```mysql -u [yourUser] [whateverElseYouNeed] < HostelReservation.sql```.

## Database

The database comes with two clients, joaoafonso and franciscacosta, where their password is their usernames.

It also comes with 5 hostels and 4 reservations.
